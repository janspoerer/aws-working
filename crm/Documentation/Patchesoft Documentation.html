<h3 id="document-84">Quick Setup Guide - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This guide is intended for quick setup. If you want a more detailed version, check out the Setup &amp; Installation document.</p>

<h1>Uploading Files</h1>

<ul>
	<li>First locate the core files in the folder: <strong>core_files/core.zip </strong>and extract them.</li>
	<li>Upload the files to your main web directory. A sub folder is fine too.</li>
	<li>Modify the file: <strong>application/config/config.php </strong>and edit the following code with your own URL to the system:
	<pre>$config['base_url']	= 'http://www.example.com/';</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Modify the file: <strong>application/config/database.php</strong> with your database settings:
	<pre>$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'your_username';
$db['default']['password'] = 'your_password';
$db['default']['database'] = 'database_name';</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Import the SQL file <strong>core_files/database.sql </strong>to the database you specified in the above settings.</li>
	<li>Run the install file on your website. This URL is usually: http://www.example.com/install/</li>
	<li>Alternative install URL: http://www.example.com/index.php/install/</li>
	<li>Delete the file application/controllers/Install.php after.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a more detailed install guide which explains everything 
more clearly, check out our Setup &amp; Installation document.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-59">Setup &amp; Installation - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<h1>Uploading Files</h1>

<p>Once you have downloaded your file from the Envato Marketplace, you 
will need to extract the files from the ZIP file. You will need to 
upload the product core files to a webserver. First locate the core 
files in the folder: <strong>core_files/core.zip</strong>. You will need
 to extract the files from the zip and upload them so that these files 
are in your main directory on your webserver, usually this is the 
public_html folder. If you wish to upload them to a sub-folder, this is 
fine too- just make sure you read the footnotes about installing in a 
sub-folder.</p>

<p>Your webserver's main directory should look something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Directory Structure" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/directory_structure.png"></p>

<h1>Config Settings</h1>

<p>Before you can use your product, you will need to edit the config files. First locate the config file in: <strong>application/config/config.php</strong> and open it up using a text editor such as notepad. The only line you should need to edit is the:</p>

<pre>$config['base_url']	= 'http://www.example.com/';</pre>

<p>Replace the http://www.example.com with your own domain name, making 
sure you keep the quotation tags around it as above. There are some 
other settings that you can also edit in this file if you feel the need 
to customise your product further but for a basic installation this is 
all you should need to edit. Save the file and overwrite the existing 
one on your webserver.</p>

<h1>Database Settings</h1>

<p>The second file you will need to edit is your database file. Find the file: <strong>application/config/database.php</strong>
 and open it up using a text editor like Notepad. You will need to edit 
the lines listed below with your own database login information. For the
 most part, host stays the same as localhost unless your web host 
specifies to you otherwise. You will need your database name, database 
username and database password.</p>

<pre>$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'your_username';
$db['default']['password'] = 'your_password';
$db['default']['database'] = 'database_name';
</pre>

<p>Once you have modified this file, save it and overwrite the existing one on your webserver.</p>

<p>Next you will need to execute the SQL file that came with the product
 download. This file will create the database tables that are used to 
store the data of your application. Usually you can import the SQL 
tables by using a database management system like PHPmyAdmin. The SQL 
file is located in <strong>core_files/database.sql</strong> in the product download.</p>

<p>To Import the file, login to your database management system, such as
 PHPmyAdmin. Make sure you are on the database that you named in the 
database.php config file then locate the Import Tab on PHPmyAdmin.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/import.png" style="height:867px; width:1096px"></p>

<p>Next select the browse button (as shown in the screenshot above) and locate the SQL file (<strong>core_files/database.sql</strong>) from your product download file. Next click the Go! button and you should now see database tables appear in the left sidebar.</p>

<h1>Mod Rewrite</h1>

<p>We use a URL routing trick called mod_rewrite. This is normally 
installed by default on most web servers and allows for URLS like: 
http://www.example.com/some/file/here/ instead of 
http://www.example.com/myfile.php.</p>

<p>If you don't have mod_rewrite settings enabled on your web server, 
you can still use the application by setting your index_page value to 
the following line in the <strong>application/config/config.php</strong> file:</p>

<pre>$config['index_page'] = 'index.php';</pre>

<p>This setting will make it so your URLs have index.php in them. 
However, the default setting is to remove this and assumes you have 
mod_rewrite enabled on your webserver.</p>

<h1>Creating the Admin Account and Setup Site</h1>

<p>Finally, you will need to run the install file in your web browser. A
 notification will pop-up on the site once you have filled out all the 
database settings and config settings linking you to the install file. 
Or you can locate it by going to <strong>http://www.example.com/install/</strong>
 where example.com is replaced by your own. Here you'll be able to 
create the Admin account with full access to the site as well as some 
initial site settings.</p>

<p>If you're having problems accessing this URL, double-check that you entered the correct information in the <strong>application/config/config.php</strong>
 file. If you are sure that it is correct, it may be something to do 
with your webserver's settings with allowing mod_rewrite. The problem 
most notably is usually with the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file in the 
main directory- make sure this file is in your main directory (like in 
the directory screenshot above). If you still have problems, check out 
our Knowlege Base or feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>If you added index.php to your config setting <strong>index_page </strong>in the<strong> </strong><strong>application/config/config.php</strong> file, the URL to install will be: <strong>http://www.mydomain.com/index.php/install/</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Once you have installed the product, please delete the file <strong>application/controllers/install.php</strong>! This will prevent other users from messing up your settings.</p>

<h1>Installing In A Sub-Folder</h1>

<p>If you're installing the software in a sub-folder, such as 
http://www.example.com/my_subfolder/ then you will need to modify the 
.htaccess file inside the main directory (the one that holds the 
application, bootstrap folders etc). All you need to do is open up the 
.htaccess file in your text editor and copy the following code, 
replacing the sub-folder with the name of your sub-folder (in this 
example, the sub-folder is called sub_folder_name_here. Replace this 
with the name of your sub-folder).</p>

<pre>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /sub_folder_name_here
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php?/$1 
</pre>

<p>Save the file as .htaccess and overwrite the one inside your main 
directory that you used to install the software in (the folder 
containing the application, bootstrap folders etc). You can skip this 
step if you're installing in your main folder.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-61">Where Everything Is - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This part of the guide is to show you where the most common elements 
of the site are located. Remember, this site uses CodeIgniter Framework,
 so for well-documented additional support, please use their website and
 user guide: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3>Styling &amp; CSS</h3>

<p>The site's styling is based off Bootstrap 3; Bootstrap 3 comes with 
lots of predefined CSS elements that you can use to create well 
presented websites with. You can view the Bootstrap documentation and 
examples here: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>. If you wish to upgrade the Bootstrap version or make your own changes to it, you can find the files in the <strong>bootstrap/</strong> directory.</p>

<p>The product also uses it's own custom styling to create the site layout. You can find the stylesheet file in <strong>styles</strong> folder.</p>

<h3>Modify HTML / Frontend interface</h3>

<p>The template files, also known as views, can be found in <strong>application/views/</strong>.
 These files contain the HTML of the site and modifying these files 
allows you to change the way the site presents data. These files also 
contain some PHP code so it's important to know what you're doing when 
editting these files.</p>

<p>The layout file can be found in <strong>application/views/layout/layout.php</strong>.</p>

<h3>PHP Logic &amp; Database Models</h3>

<p>The controller files, which contain the site logic, can be found in <strong>application/controllers/</strong> folder. These are PHP files that are used to control how the site works.</p>

<p>The model files can be found in <strong>application/models/</strong> which contain the database logic.</p>

<h3>Javascript &amp; Libraries</h3>

<p>The Javascript files can be found in the <strong>scripts/</strong> folder. The <strong>custom/</strong> folder contains custom made scripts for the site and the <strong>libraries/</strong> folder contains 3rd-party plugins that we use.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-66">Dashboard - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Your dashboard will present you with an overview of your current 
projects. The dashboard is customised for each user, based on the 
projects they are assigned to, their user roles and the sections 
enabled.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p1.png"></p>

<p>The Dashboard provides information on the following sections:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Finances</li>
	<li>Tasks</li>
	<li>Notifications</li>
	<li>Invoices</li>
	<li>Tickets</li>
	<li>Recent Activity</li>
	<li>Timer Usage</li>
</ul>

<p>The stats at the top of the dashboard of <strong>cached</strong>, 
meaning they update every couple of hours. This is because they rely on 
resource intensive database queries which can slow your site down if 
they are run all the time. Caching them allows you to store the results 
and grab them quickly.</p>

<p>The top navigation bar allows you to view any notifications, timers 
or messages you get. Clicking on one of the icons will produce a new 
window that contains any relevant information. These can be accessed 
anywhere on the site, making it easy to access your most important 
information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-67">Mailbox - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Titan provides each user with their own on site mailbox, allowing 
users on the system to send messages to each other. Each time you 
recieve a new message you'll get a notification in the top navigation 
bar. You can access your Mailbox by clicking on the Mail Icon and 
selecting the Go To Mailbox link.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p2.png"></p>

<p>To send a message to another user, all you need to know is their <strong>username</strong>.
 You can type their username into the Username field box and the system 
will attempt to find users matching your input automatically.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p3.png"></p>

<p>You can also search messages in your Mailbox using the Search Bar. It searches for content in the message title and body.</p>

<p>And users can also block other users from messaging them by using the
 Block User system. All the user needs to do is add the Username to 
their block list and that user will no longer be able to send them a 
message.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-68">Projects - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The basis of TITAN is Projects. You can create an unlimited amount of projects and assign different users access to them. As an <strong>admin</strong> you'll be able to view all projects but a normal user will only see projects they are a member of.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p4.png"></p>

<p>You can group projects into categories. An <strong>Admin</strong> can create new categories in the Categories section, where they can specify name and color.</p>

<p>A user with the user role <strong>Admin, Project Admin </strong>or <strong>Project Worker</strong> can create projects. A <strong>Project Admin</strong> can access any project whereas a <strong>Project Worker</strong> can create projects but only access ones they create. Users without these permissions won't be able to create projects.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p5.png"></p>

<p>When you create a Project you can give it a name, icon and 
description. You can also set the progress of the Project by entering a %
 value or use the Sync option which will base the completion of the 
Project on how many Tasks are remaining/completed.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p6.png"></p>

<p>There is also the option of selecting a project as your <strong>Active Project</strong>.
 This will make it so that when you view a certain section of the site, 
such as Tasks, only Tasks for this Project will be displayed by default.
 You can switch between all projects you are a part of by going to the 
Projects section or using the top navigation bar and selecting your 
Active Project.</p>

<p>You can also set the status of a Project to <strong>Archived</strong>.
 When you set a project to Archived the data for that Project will no 
longer be displayed (such as tasks, files, calendar events etc.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-69">Calendar - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>TITAN comes with it's own fully working Calendar. Each Project can 
have it's own separate Calendar. By default, when you view the Calendar 
you'll see all events for all the Projects you are a member of.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p7.png"></p>

<p>There is also a <strong>Global Calendar</strong>. This Calendar can be viewed by all users using the <strong>Calendar Worker </strong>or <strong>Calendar Manager</strong> user roles. Any events added to the Global Calendar can be viewed, regardless of what Project the user is a member of.</p>

<p>Each Project also has it's own separate Calendar. You can view events
 for a specific Project by selecting the View By Project option and 
choosing a Project to view.</p>

<p>When you click a square, you can add an Event to a certain date. Each
 Event has a start time and end time. Events can span across multiple 
days.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p8.png"></p>

<p>You can also setup the Calendar system to use <strong>Google Calendars</strong>.
 In order to use Google Calendars you need to enable the Google Calendar
 API on your Google Developers Account. Check out our Article on setting
 up Google Calendars to work with Titan.</p>

<p>A Project can also have a separate Google Calendar assigned to it. 
This can be done when creating/editing a Project from the Projects 
section. You'll need to provide the Google Calendar ID to your Project. 
Then when you view the Project in the Calendar section, that Google 
Calendar will be loaded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-70">Tasks &amp; Objectives - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>One of the core components of TITAN is Tasks. Each Project can have 
an unlimited amount of Tasks added to it. Each Task has it's own area 
where you members of the project can view the task details.</p>

<p>Only members of the Project can create Tasks (unless they are an Admin) that have the <strong>Project Role Tasks</strong> assigned to them. A user with <strong>Task Manager</strong> can access all tasks. A user with <strong>Task Worker</strong> can access only Tasks that are a part of projects they are a member of.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p9.png"></p>

<p>A task can have a start date, due date and a name. You can also set 
the status of a Task to show users how the Task is progressing. You can 
also sync the completion rate of a task with the number of objectives 
marked as complete.</p>

<p>Each Task can have Objectives added to it. These are like sub-tasks 
that are grouped by tasks. It allows you to organise who is tackling 
what section of a task. A user can mark an objective as complete when 
they have completed the Task.</p>

<p>Each Task also shows the amount of time logged for the task. When you
 create timers, you can assign a Task to the timer and then the timer 
data will be assigned to the Task.</p>

<p>A Task also has a message section where members of the task can 
comment on it, leave feedback or important messages that need to be 
viewed.</p>

<p>You'll also notice that each Task can have members assigned to it. 
When a member is assigned to a task, they are given a notification and 
that Task is then put under a user's Assigned Tasks list, allowing them 
to see what they need to complete.</p>

<p>If the Task has any important Files that are required, you can assign
 Files to the Task so that they are displayed to all users who are 
involved in the Task for easy access.</p>

<p>TITAN has a File Manager system in place that allows you to upload 
files. The File Manager works like a virtual file directory where you 
can store files in folders. Files can also be assigned to projects so 
that they can only be viewed/used by members of a certain project.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p11.png"></p>

<p>When adding a file, you can set what file types you accept in the 
Admin panel. Each file has it's own page where you can view details of 
the file, download it and also post comments on it.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p12.png"></p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-72">Teams - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Each Project has a Team of users that can be assigned permissions called <strong>Project Roles</strong>. These roles are different to that of <strong>User Roles</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p13.png"></p>

<p>The Admin of a Project can add members to the Project's Team. You can
 view the team of a specific Project by selecting it from the View By 
Project list. Each member in the Team can be assigned a <strong>Project User Role</strong>.</p>

<p>Project Roles can be used to restrict a certain user from within that
 single project. For example, a User which has access to Tasks can be 
restricted from accessing tasks for a certain Project by denying the 
user the <strong>Task Project Role</strong>.</p>

<p>In most cases, if a user has the <strong>User Role</strong> of a manager they will have access to all data within that section. For example, a user with the <strong>Task Manager </strong>user role has access to all Tasks regardless of their Project Role. However, a user with the User Role <strong>Task Worker </strong>will need the Task Project Role in order to access tasks for a specific Project. The <strong>Admin Project Role </strong>gives the user access to all sections for that project.</p>

<p>An <strong>Admin</strong> can create new <strong>Project User Roles </strong>in the <strong>Team Roles</strong>
 section. This section lets you view all current roles and also allows 
you to modify the permissions of roles. When you create a new role, it 
will appear as an option when adding new team members to your project's 
team.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p14.png"></p>

<p>The current list of Project Roles are:</p>

<table style="height:235px; width:728px" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1">
	<tbody>
		<tr>

<h3 id="document-73">Timers - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Timers allow you to track how much time you are spending working on 
Projects. Timers are very easy to use; as soon as you begin working you 
can start a timer by clicking on the top navigation bar and selecting 
the Start Timer button. Timers can be assigned to Projects (or none) so 
that you can see where your time is being spent the most.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p15.png"></p>

<p>You can view all your timers in the Timers section. When you assign a
 Timer to a Project, there is also the option of assigning it to a Task 
within that Project. Then when you go to view a Task, it will show how 
much time has been spent on a Task.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p16.png"></p>

<p>You can also view the Your Stats page which shows you a breakdown of 
how much time you have spent. You can view by the last 7 days, last 30 
days or last 90 days. You can also view by a specific Month.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p17.png"></p>

<p>One other point to mention is that you can also assign an hourly rate
 to your User account. The Timer will then calculate how much you have 
potentially earned based on your hourly rate. This setting can be set in
 the User Settings section.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-74">Ticket System - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>TITAN provides a Ticketing System so that you can offer support to 
your clients. Tickets can also be assigned to users (staff) so that you 
can easily organise who should be helping who. A user needs the <strong>Ticket Manager</strong> User Role in order to be able to use the Ticket system.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p18.png"></p>

<p>A ticket can be created by any user. If an <strong>Admin</strong> 
creates a ticket, they can assign it to a user themselves and also 
specify the client of the ticket. Each ticket also has a replies 
section, where users can discuss the issue back and forth. Every time 
there is a new reply, each user is notified using the notification 
system.</p>

<p>When you create a Ticket, you can view all the ticket's details on a 
special ticket page. This page contains User Information, attached 
files, replies and Staff notes that allow you to provide the best 
support for your clients.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p19.png"></p>

<p>Clicking on the Client Details button will provide extra details 
about the Client (the user who created the ticket). These details 
include their first and last names and also their address.</p>

<p>Each Ticket can have files attached to it also, including replies. 
The file types allowed can be specified in the Admin Panel. You can also
 disable Ticket File Uploading in the Admin Panel. Files uploaded here 
are not added to the File Manager.</p>

<p>The Assigned Tickets section will display any tickets that have been assigned to you.</p>

<p>Departments are Ticket categories which an <strong>Admin</strong> can create to help organise tickets better.</p>

<p>You can also create custom fields for tickets. Custom Fields allow 
you to obtain extra information when a user fills out the ticket 
creation form. You can create many different field types.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p20.png"></p>

<p>The Your Tickets section will display any tickets that you have created. This section is mostly useful to your clients.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-76">Invoices - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>TITAN provides the ability to generate Invoices for clients. You can 
create an Invoice for anyone. The Invoice Section will list all Invoices
 that have been currently generated, along with whether or not they have
 been paid, the total amount and more. Invoices are currently payable by
 PayPal. Once payment has been accepted, the Invoice's status 
automatically updates to Paid.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p22.png"></p>

<p>An Invoice can be viewed in two different ways. The first way is via a
 web URL that has a generated Pay Now button that allows you to collect 
payments. Then there is also a Download PDF version, which allows you to
 generate a PDF version of the invoice and download it.</p>

<p>You can change the logo on Invoices and the default site address in the Admin Panel.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p24.png"></p>

<p>When creating an Invoice, you can create multiple items that are 
calculated automatically towards the total cost. We have also added in 
two Tax options that can be applied to the cost of the items.</p>

<p>An Invoice can also be marked as a "Template". An Invoice Template 
can be used as a basis for reoccuring invoices, where the invoice items 
are kept as the original.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p23.png"></p>

<p>Reoccuring invoices can be created in the Reoccuring section. A 
reoccuring Invoice makes use of Invoice Templates to generate an Invoice
 at certain intervals. You can have an invoice reoccur x days, x weeks 
or x months. These settings can be made by you.</p>

<p>In order to setup reoccuring invoices, you need to run the Invoice Cron once per day:</p>

<p>0 * * * * * wget http://www.yoursite.com/titan-folder/cron/invoices</p>

<p>where the application is installed in http://www.yoursite.com/titan-folder/.</p>

<p>You can also set some reoccuring invoices to pause and also give them end dates in which they won't reoccur after that point.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-75">Finance Section - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Finance Section allows you to manage any costs or profits you may
 make from your projects. You can easily add entries into the system, 
assign them to projects and see a detailed progress of the data on your 
dashboard.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p21.png"></p>

<p>Entries accept positive and negative amounts. You can also group Finances into categories using the Categories section.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-77">Notes - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Notes section of TITAN allows you to store your thoughts, 
snippets, logs, to-do lists or just anything you'd like. You can assign 
notes to a project so that only certain notes are available to members 
of a certain project.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p25.png"></p>

<p>By clicking on a note, you can view it in it's entirety. Users with the <strong>Note Manager </strong>user role can edit/add/delete notes of any user/project. Users with the <strong>Note Project Role</strong> can only add/edit their own notes for a specific project.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-137">Services - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Services is an area that allows you to create order forms for 
customers. Customers can then fill out the form, the order is sent to 
you, an invoice is generated automatically for the customer and then you
 can complete the service once the invoice has been paid.</p>

<p>Access to the Services section is given to users with the User Role <strong>Admin</strong> and <strong>Service Manager</strong>.</p>

<p><br>
<img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p34.png"></p>

<p>If you prefer to manually generate the invoices, you can deselect the option Auto-Generate Invoice.</p>

<p>You can add custom fields to your service form that allow you to 
present more options to your customer. You can even add in additional 
costs whenever a field is filled out. This allows you to be very 
flexible with your services offered.</p>

<p>Once a customer fills out a form, they will be redirected to their 
Invoice so they can pay. Invoices can be paid via PayPal, Stripe or 
2Checkout. You'll receive a notification each time you get a new order. 
The invoice is also emailed to the customer to remind them.</p>

<p>The orders section will show you a list of orders made for your 
services, including the status of the invoice (paid or unpaid). You can 
view the order details by clicking the edit icon. From there you can 
also change the order details, generate a new invoice or send a reminder
 to the customer.</p>

<p>Each service has two default fields: Name and Email. These are used on the Invoice to show who it is being paid by.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-78">Quote System - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Whilst using TITAN, you can also gather feedback from clients by 
creating Quote Forms. Quote Forms are custom-built forms that you can 
make and give to clients by sending them to specific URLs. It's great 
way to ask the same questions to multiple clients to get the information
 you need.</p>

<p>A custom quote form can contain many different questions and fields 
so that you can collect the right data. When you add a new Quote Form, 
you presented with a page that allows you to build the form using our 
Quote Form Builder.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p26.png"></p>

<p>You can assign a user to a form so that when you get a response from 
that form, your assigned user will get a notification telling them there
 is a new quote to review.</p>

<p>When a client uses your quote form, the quotes get processed and 
stored in the Quote section. This section will display all your quote 
form responses, showing you which form they came from, who submitted 
them and the status of the quote. You can change the status from Unread 
to Read so you can keep track of what Quotes you have read.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p27.png"></p>

<p>You may notice that the User column has a Guest entry. This is 
because when you send out your Quote Forms to clients, the user does not
 need to be logged in or registered in order to submit a request. This 
can allow you to interact with potential clients quickly without them 
having to fill out unnecessary forms.</p>

<p>When you click on the user's quote, you can see all of their replies 
and responses to the questions in your quote form. You can also save 
your own notes to the quote so that you can remember what you were 
thinking when reading it.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-79">Admin Panel - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Admin Panel is only available to users with the user role <strong>Super Admin, Admin Members, Admin Settings </strong>or <strong>Admin Payment</strong>. These user roles allow the user to specific areas of the Admin Panel, except for <strong>Super Admin</strong> which has access to everything.</p>

<p>The frontpage of the Admin Panel shows the recently registered 
members. It shows who registered, what service they registered with (if 
you have social media registration setup) and a graph of the last months
 count of registered users.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p28.png"></p>

<p>The Admin Panel has many sections that allow you to manage your TITAN application.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Global Settings </strong>The global settings page allows 
you to change the logo, name and many other site-wide settings. It 
allows you to disable registration, enable brute force login protection,
 specify file types and file sizes and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Settings</strong> The social settings is where you 
place your social media API keys. These settings allow users to create 
accounts on TITAN using their Facebook, Twitter and Google Accounts.</li>
	<li><strong>Calendar Settings</strong> You can also change the way your
 Calendar works. There are two types of Calendars you can use: Site 
Calendar or Google Calendar. The site calendar uses the on site database
 to store events whereas the Google Calendar uses Google's Calendar API 
to connect to existing Calendars and load their data. Here you'll be 
able to specify the API keys to connect to Google Calendar.</li>
	<li><strong>Section Settings</strong> The section settings allows you 
to turn off various areas of TITAN. You can enable/disable any of the 
main areas: Calendar, Tasks, Files, Teams, Notes, Invoices, Finance, 
Quotes and Timers.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p29.png"></p>

<p>The Admin panel also allows you to manage all your Members. You can 
edit/delete/add members. You can see all their information by clicking 
on Edit User. You can change their password, email address and also 
their User Role.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p30.png"></p>

<p>TITAN has a powerful User Role system. It allows you to completely 
control the permissions users have on your site. You can create custom 
roles with different permissions and assign them to individual users. 
This section describes all the User Roles and what permissions they 
give. You can view what each role does by hovering over the Role in the 
Admin Panel.</p>

<p>You can mix permissions together. So you could have a User Role called <strong>Intern</strong> and give them the roles of <strong>Finance Worker, </strong><strong>Invoice Client </strong>and <strong>Notes Worker</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>User Groups</strong> User Groups allow you to group users together. If you need to keep your members organised, you can assign them into groups.</li>
	<li><strong>IP Blocking</strong> IP Blocking prevents users from logging in using a specific IP.</li>
	<li><strong>Ticket Settings</strong> Ticket Settings allow you to setup
 Email Piping. This allows users to respond to tickets by using their 
Email Address rather than logging int othe ticket system.</li>
	<li><strong>Email Templates</strong> Email Templates allow you change what emails are sent to users.</li>
	<li><strong>Email Members</strong> This section allows you to send 
emails directly from your site to your registered users. You can also 
send out mass emails to User Groups.</li>
	<li><strong>Currencies</strong> Currencies are just a list of currencies that can be used from Invoices.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p31.png"></p>

<p>Invoice Settings allow you to change the logo that is displayed on 
the Invoice and also the default address. The default address can be 
replaced by a User-specific address when the Invoice is created.</p>

<h3 id="document-60">Application Structure - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This application is built up around the CodeIgniter framework. 
CodeIgniter is built directly into the software, so you don't have to do
 anything extra to use it.</p>

<p>For developers, this framework is freely available on the internet 
and documentation for using the source code can be founded on their 
website: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a>.</p>

<p>CodeIgniter is a PHP Framework written in MVC (model-view-controller)
 format which allows developers to create applications that are 
structured in a very clean and efficient way. When you unzip the product
 download (core_files/code.zip), you will be presented with the 
following directory structure. Below is a quick overview of where you 
can find various files if you are new to using CodeIgniter.</p>

<p><img alt="Directory Structure" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/directory_structure.png" style="height:227px; width:205px"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>application</strong> - This is where the main application 
files are kept. It includes the configuaration files, the class 
controllers, models and view files. If you want to make changes to the 
application, you should modify these files.</li>
	<li><strong>bootstrap</strong> - The bootstrap Javascript and CSS files.</li>
	<li><strong>images</strong> - Images used in the application are stored here.</li>
	<li><strong>scripts</strong> - Custom Javascript files made for use with the application.</li>
	<li><strong>styles</strong> - Custom CSS files made for use with the application.</li>
	<li><strong>system</strong> - The core CodeIgniter files are present here. These should not be modified unless upgrading the CodeIgniter version.</li>
	<li><strong>uploads</strong> - This folder is used to store user uploads.</li>
	<li><strong>user_guide</strong> - Documentation on how to use CodeIgniter.</li>
	<li><strong>.htaccess</strong> - This file is used to tell your web server to process URLs.</li>
	<li><strong>index.php</strong> - The application bootup file.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information on directory structure at the CodeIgniter website and reading the User Guide: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-62">Modifying the HTML &amp; CSS - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>You can modify the HTML and CSS of the product to match the look and 
feel of your website. You can manually edit the CSS files that control 
the site's look and feel.</p>

<p>You can find the CSS file in <strong>styles/main.css</strong>. Here 
you will be able to see the current rules that have been created for the
 site. You may want to put your own rules at the bottom of the file, or 
even create your own CSS file and include that into the site layout. 
This will be useful should you ever wish to upgrade the product with a 
newer version and your settings won't be overwritten.</p>

<p>You may also wish to change the HTML of the site. All HTML files are inside the <strong>application/views/</strong> folders. The layout HTML file can be found in <strong>application/views/layout/layout.php</strong>.
 This file is the core of the site structure. There are some PHP coding 
inside the HTML files which is used to generate the dynamic content; we 
suggest not modifying these as it could cause unexpected errors in your 
system.</p>

<p>Remember, you can find out more information on how to use Views, 
Controllers and Models using the CodeIgniter framework by reading their 
documentation: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3 id="document-80">How To Setup Google Calendar - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This is a guide on how to setup Google Calendar to work with the 
Calendar system on TITAN. If you can't setup the Google Calendar, you 
can alternatively use the Site Calendar option in the Admin Panel, which
 stores all events on the local database.</p>

<p>Let's begin.</p>

<p>You will need a Google Account in order to enable the Google Calendar
 API. Make sure you're logged into your Google Account before 
continuing.</p>

<p>First you need to create a Project in the Google Developers Console. If you haven't done this yet, you can follow this link: <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar&amp;authuser=1&amp;pli=1">https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar&amp;authuser=1&amp;pli=1</a></p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/c1.png"></p>

<p>This will create a default project called My Project and also enable 
the Google Calendar API for&nbsp; you. It will take a couple of minutes 
to setup.</p>

<p>Once created, you'll be presented with the Credentials page. You want to select the <strong>Web Browser (Javascript)&nbsp; </strong>option for the first drop down menu and <strong>User Data </strong>for the second drop down menu.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/c2.png"></p>

<p>The next step is creating your "Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID". This 
is so users can authenticate with google and pull the google calendar 
data. You want to fill out the form like so:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Name: Name of your application (titan)</li>
	<li>Authorized Javascript Restrictions: Your website's domain that contains Titan. I.e. http://pms.patchesoft.com</li>
	<li>Authorized Redirect URLs: The URL that points to your Calendar: http://pms.patchesoft.com/calendar/</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/c3.png"></p>

<p>On the next screen you'll finalize the details. Give your application
 a name and the email address you want to display to users when they get
 a request to access the Google Calendar. Once complete, you'll be 
presented with your <strong>Google Client ID</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/c4.png"></p>

<p>Next you want to create the API Key. To do this, click the Create 
Credentials button on the Credentials page. From the dropdown menu, 
select API Key. This is your <strong>Google Calendar API Key</strong>.</p>

<p>To get your <strong>Google Client Secret</strong> key, you need to 
select the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs that you just created and select the 
Edit Button. At the top of the page should be the Google Client Secret 
listed.</p>

<p>You now have all the keys needed. There is just one thing left: the <strong>Google Calendar ID</strong> of the Google Calendar you wish to use.</p>

<p>To obtain this, go to your Google Calendars (<a href="https://calendar.google.com/">https://calendar.google.com/</a>) and select the Create New Calendar option by clicking on the My Calendars dropdown menu.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/c5.png"></p>

<p>Name your calendar and also make sure to select the <strong>Make This Calendar Public</strong> sharing setting. If this is not selected, the Google Calendar API won't be able to fetch the calendar data.<img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/c6.png"></p>

<p>Create your Calendar and then go to Edit Calendar by clicking on the 
dropdown menu beside the Calendar Name under My Calendars. Select 
Calendar Settings. On this page, you'll find the <strong>Google Calendar ID</strong>. It's normally in the form of an email address.</p>

<p>You now have all the details needed to start the Google Calendar. 
Enter them into your TITAN application via the Admin Panel Calendar

<h3 id="document-81">How to setup PayPal for Invoices - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>When using the Invoice system, you can allow them to be paid directly
 using PayPal. The system will automatically mark the invoice as paid 
when it is paid through by PayPal. In order to do this though, you need 
to setup PayPal's IPN settings. This guide will show you how you can do 
that.</p>

<h3>PayPal IPN Setup</h3>

<p>Now you need to go to PayPal.com and turn on your IPN. IPN stands for
 the Instant Payment Notification system and it is used to automatically
 mark invoices as paid. (making it so you don't have to manually mark 
the invoices yourself.).</p>

<p>First login to your Paypal account. Click on the Profile link in the 
top-right corner and navigate to My Profile settings page. You should 
see a host of options in the left sidebar now.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_4.png"></p>

<p>click on the My Selling Preferences and find the Instant Payment Notifications Update link.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_5.png"></p>

<p>Now you need to enable and turn on IPN messages. In the Notification 
URL you need to enter the domain name you are using to host the system 
along with: IPN/process. So if I had installed the&nbsp; software on 
http://framework.patchesoft.com/ my URL would be: 
http://framework.patchesoft.com/IPN/process</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/prologin_o_6.png"></p>

<p>Save the settings. Once done, you should now be able to receive 
payments and your invoices should automatically be being marked as paid.
 If you're having issues, try checking the IPN History page in PayPal 
which shows any requests it is trying to send out, along with any error 
messages/issues: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-ipns-history">https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_display-ipns-history</a></p>

<h3 id="document-82">How to setup reoccuring Invoices - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>In order to setup reoccuring invoices, you need to add a cron job to 
your site. We recommend having the cron execute once per day. The 
following cron settings need to be applied:</p>

<p>0 * * * * * wget http://www.yoursite.com/cron/invoices</p>

<p>The cron job will then execute once every day (usually at midnight) 
and generate the reoccuring invoices if any are available. Make sure you
 have invoices to be generated by setting them up in the Reoccuring 
Invoices section of the system.</p>

<p>If you're using cPanel, this guide may be helpful in <a href="https://confluence2.cpanel.net/display/ALD/Cron+Jobs">setting up a cron job</a>.</p>

<h3 id="document-83">How to setup iMap for Tickets - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Ticket System can use PHP's iMap extension to automatically check
 an inbox for replied ticket responses. Those responses are then turned 
into ticket replies, stored in the database and presented on TITAN's 
Ticket View page.</p>

<p>You can setup iMap to be used with your SMTP server. In order to do 
that, you need to make sure you have iMap PHP extension installed on 
your system.</p>

<p>Once done, you'll need to get the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Protocol Host &amp; Port</li>
	<li>SMTP Email Address</li>
	<li>SMTP Password</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have these settings, you need to put them in your <strong>Ticket Settings</strong> in the <strong>Admin Panel</strong>. We used GMail for our SMTP server and the settings look like the screenshot below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p32.png"></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using a GMail account, you need to 
make sure you have enabled iMap settings. You can do this by going to 
your Gmail Inbox, clicking Settings and then Forwarding and POP/IMAP. 
Once you select enable, make sure you click the Save button.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/p33.png"></p>

<p>Once you have saved these settings, you then need to setup a cron job
 to check the SMTP server every x minutes. We recommend every 5 minutes,
 but you can change it to 1 minute, 10 minutes or however many times you
 like. The longer the time you set, the less amount of times the script 
will check for email replies and update your tickets.</p>

<p>The cron in question should be:</p>

<p>*/5 * * * * * wget http://yoursite.com/cron/ticket_replies</p>

<p>You can find this cron URL also in the Ticket Settings page.</p>

<p>Once you have set your cron up, you should test out your Tickets. 
Create a ticket with a different email address than the one you used for
 SMTP and you should receive an email notification. In your inbox, reply
 to that email and then wait 5 minutes (or however long you set the cron
 up to check the SMTP server) and you should see your email reply 
attached to the ticket as a ticket reply on TITAN.</p>

<p>If you want to verify that your IMAP is working, visit the cron URL 
in your browser and you should see any error messages. If it's blank, it
 means it's working.</p>

<h3 id="document-63">Languages - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>If you would like to translate your product into another language, 
then you can do so by modifying the language files. Follow the simple 
steps below to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a new folder inside the application/language/ folder. Give 
the folder the name of your language, such as spanish, italian etc. For 
this example, I will call mine <strong>french</strong>.</li>
	<li>Copy the 3 files from inside application/language/english/ to the newly created folder that you just made.</li>
	<li>Inside your new language folder you should now have a <strong>content_lang.php</strong>, <strong>error_lang.php</strong> and <strong>success_lang.php</strong>. You can also add the index.html file too.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are now ready to begin editting these files.</p>

<p>The <strong>content_lang.php</strong> contains all translations for most of the content pages on the site. The <strong>error_lang.php</strong>
 file contains all the error messages that are given to users when they 
do something wrong. You are free to translate them all or just a few. 
The main one should be the content_lang.php as those translations are 
the ones your users will mostly see.</p>

<p>To edit the translations, all you need to do is type the new correct 
text inside the double quotes. For example, the following is a couple of
 lines from the content_lang.php file:</p>

<pre>			$lang['ctn_3'] = "Provide Us Feedback";
			$lang['ctn_4'] = "Email Address";
		</pre>

<p>To translate, you just need to modify the text within the double quotes. For example, a french translation would be:</p>

<pre>			$lang['ctn_3'] = "Fournir nous Commentaires";
			$lang['ctn_4'] = "Adresse e-mail";
		</pre>

<p>Save the file when your done. The final step for your translations to
 take place, you need to edit the application/config/config.php file. 
Change the following line:</p>

<pre>		$config['language']	= 'english';
		</pre>

<p>to the name of the folder that you stored your new language files in. In my case, it was french, so I change it to:</p>

<pre>		$config['language']	= 'french';
		</pre>

<p>Save config.php and you should see your new translations take place.</p>

<p><strong>Extra</strong></p>

<p>You may also need to add the System translation files. These files 
are for generic System errors. We recommend performing the following 
steps:</p>

<p>You&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;a&nbsp;folder&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;Systems&nbsp;language&nbsp;folder&nbsp;for&nbsp;your&nbsp;new&nbsp;language.
 The folder name needs to be the same name as your new language. In the 
example below, it's "<strong>spanish</strong>". Please&nbsp;follow&nbsp;these&nbsp;steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1)&nbsp;Create&nbsp;a&nbsp;folder&nbsp;inside&nbsp;system/language/&nbsp;called&nbsp;<strong>spanish</strong></li>
	<li>2)&nbsp;Locate&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;folder:&nbsp;system/language/english/</li>
	<li>3)&nbsp;Copy&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;files&nbsp;inside&nbsp;this&nbsp;folder&nbsp;to&nbsp;your&nbsp;newly&nbsp;created&nbsp;folder&nbsp;(system/language/<strong>spanish</strong>/)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Dynamic/Multiple Languages</h1>

<p>This software also has the option for the user to change the language
 themselves. The available languages are based on the translations you 
have done. A user can change the language of the site by clicking the 
Change Language link in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>You can add as many available languages are you like. You just need 
to make sure you have created the language files and folders, as 
outlined in the guide above.</p>

<p>To make a language available for selection, you need to edit the main
 config file: application/config/config.php. Look for this line:</p>

<pre>			$config['available_languages'] = array(
	          "english" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "English",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          )
            );
</pre>

<p>This is where you need to add your other languages. For example, to add your French language, edit the code so it says:</p>

<pre>			$config['available_languages'] = array(
	          "english" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "English",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          ),
              "french" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "French",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          )
            );
</pre>

<p>Now when the user visits the Change Language page, the option for 
French will appear in the menu. Remember, make sure the language files 
(in this case French) have been added too as outlined in the Language 
Guide above.</p>

<p><strong>RTL-SUPPORT</strong>: If you need to enable right-to-left 
text, for your language you need to change "rtl_support" =&gt; 0 to 
"rtl_support" =&gt; 1. This will then set the page to change text to 
RTL.</p>
