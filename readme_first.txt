Directory Structure

===================


- The ‘app’ folder contains the application.
- The ‘docs’ folder contains the documentation, including the installation process.
- The ‘local’ folder contains the ‘easy_forms.sql’ file with the database structure.

Before Installing Easy Forms

============================



1. Only upload the ‘app’ folder files to your server.

2. Open the ‘docs/index.html’ file. This file will guide you through the installation process.

IMPORTANT! When you run in localhost (WAMP or Xampp), the Easy Form installer may have trouble installing the database. In this case, you must first import the ‘local/easy_forms.sql’ file to your database. Then continue with the installation process.

Note: The changelog file is located in the 'app' folder.
